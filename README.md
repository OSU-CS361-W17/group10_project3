# cs361 Project 3
This is the code you will use as a starting point for Project 3.  The code you have been given has the back end for a [battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game. All instructions for this assignment are available on Canvas.

### Tips and tricks:

To implement this code, you will be using [Java Spark](http://sparkjava.com).

You will make your life MUCH easier if you use [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) to seralize/deserialize the JSON objects to/from java objects.

You might also find the jquery documentation useful.

### Requirements Checklist:

- [x] **Repository initialization**

- [ ] **Create a Sequence Diagram of Front-end/Back-end Communications.** Based upon the version of Battleship that your team developed for Project Stage 2, create a sequence diagram that represents all of the communications between the back-end (Model) and front-end (View) components. You can refer to lecture slides, the Agile Modeling website, and any other online references for instructions on drafting sequence diagrams. The sequence diagram can either be composed using UML modeling software, or drawn on paper (drawings should be labelled and legible). Scan and add this diagram to your group's Wiki pages.

- [ ] **Create UML Class Diagrams for your solution.** This step involves creating 3 different UML class diagrams.
  - [ ] The first diagram should represent the class structure of your Battleship game from Project Stage 2.
  - [ ] The second diagram should represent the expected class structure of your Battleship game with changes incorporated based upon the features listed above.
  - [ ] The third diagram should represent the actual class structure of your final version after all of the requested features have been implemented.
  - The second and third diagram could potentially look the same, but they are much more likely to differ based upon your group's actual implementation.
  - The third diagram must match the version of your group's code that is submitted at the end of this assignment.
  - These diagrams can either be composed using UML modeling software, or drawn on paper (drawings should be labelled and legible).
  - [ ] Scan and add this diagram to your group's Wiki pages (names should be added to indicate the author of each diagram).

- [ ] **Implement Requested Features in Object-Oriented Design.** Groups should divide the work equally for implementing all necessary user stories and their associated features as requested above.
  - [ ] The Java code in the Model portion of your Battleship game must adhere to Object-Oriented design (the Inheritance requirement in particular). 
  - [ ] User stories must be added to the group Wiki for each new feature (follow INVEST for these). 
  - [ ] Tasks must be added into the GitHub Issue page on your group's Project Stage 3 repository.
  - [ ] Each group member must have at least one issue assigned to them, and that task must involve implementation code that is added via Pull Request.
  - [ ] Each group member is also responsible for constructively commenting on another group member's Pull Request.
